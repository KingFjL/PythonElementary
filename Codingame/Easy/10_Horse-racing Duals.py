'''
Casablancaâ€™s hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. During a dual, only two horses will participate in the race.
In order for the race to be interesting, it is necessary to try to select two horses with similar strength.

Write a program which, using a given number of strengths, identifies the two closest strengths and shows their difference with an 
integer (â‰¥ 0).
